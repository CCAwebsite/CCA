<p>Kache is committed to working with her home community and influencing the next generation. “As a CCA alum it’s important for me to set an example for future generations. While attending CCA, I had many opportunities to work with professional dancers. Having an opportunity to see those dancers perform, and take classes from them fueled me to become the artist I am today. If I could have changed anything about my experience, it would have been to meet professional dancers from my school, or at least from Chattanooga. It’s important to see yourself in the world. I didn’t have that – as a Tennessean, and especially as a woman of color. I made my way, but I did it without seeing what it would look like. I’ve been very lucky, and I want to share that,” says Kache.</p>
<p>The two pieces choreographed by Kache will appear on the Project Motion spring concert April 21 & 21 in the CCA Auditorium.</p>

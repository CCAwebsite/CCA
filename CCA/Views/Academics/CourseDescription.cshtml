<h5>About the Curriculum:</h5>

<strong>Center for Creative Arts</strong> offers a college prep curriculum for every student. We believe that is our obligation to rigorously prepare students for college and post-secondary success. The courses presented encompass the academics every student needs to be successful along with an impressive array of artistic offerings. At CCA, arts and academics share center stage.

The academic year features an A-B block schedule with year-long classes that meet on alternating days. Students take four 90-minute classes each day and earn up to eight credits per year. A minimum of 28 Carnegie units is required by Hamilton County Department of Education for graduation, including 4 in English, 4 in Mathematics, 2 in Foreign Language, 4 in Laboratory Science, 3 in Social Studies, 1 in Life Wellness, 0.5 in Senior Seminar, 0.5 in Personal Finance, and 0.5 in PE. All students choose a major in Visual Arts, Theatre, Dance, Instrumental Music, Vocal Music, or Communications. Many elective arts courses are also offered. All Advanced Placement (AP) classes at CCA offer an optional AP test for college credit and placement in May of each year. Registration for those tests typically begins in February or March.
<h5>Writing Across the Curriculum:</h5>
One school-wide priority at <strong>Center for Creative Arts</strong> is the integration of writing in all classes. Our students are routinely challenged to read a variety of complex texts carefully; to synthesize the information from those texts; and to write in response to high level texts. The Tennessee Department of Education states “Students should be able to answer a range of text-dependent questions, in which the answers require inferences based on careful attention to the text.” Writing is not just reserved for English classes at CCA, but an activity that is found among various academic and art classes.
